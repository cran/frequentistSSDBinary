Description: A study based on the screened selection design (SSD) is an exploratory phase II randomized trial with two or more arms but without concurrent control. The primary aim of the SSD trial is to pick a desirable treatment arm (e.g., in terms of the response rate) to recommend to the subsequent randomized phase IIb (with the concurrent control) or phase III. The proposed designs can “partially” control or provide the empirical type I error/false positive rate by an optimal algorithm (implemented by the optimal_2arm_binary() or optimal_3arm_binary() function) for each arm. All the design needed components (sample size, operating characteristics) are supported.
